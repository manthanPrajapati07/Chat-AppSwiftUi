## 📁 Project Structure (MVVM)


## 🔧 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/SwiftUI-ChatApp-Demo.git
cd SwiftUI-ChatApp-Demo 

2. Install Dependencies
No external package managers (like CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager) are used apart from Firebase. You just need to have Xcode and Firebase SDK installed.

3. Set Up Firebase
⚠️ Important: The file GoogleService-Info.plist has been excluded from this repository for security reasons.
To run the project successfully:

Go to Firebase Console and create a new project.
Enable Phone Authentication and set up Cloud Firestore.
Download the GoogleService-Info.plist file for your iOS app.
Add it to your Xcode project by:
Dragging it into the Xcode project navigator
Ensuring it's added to your app target
